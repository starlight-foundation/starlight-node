# starlight-node
Starlight is a protocol for decentralized digital money built from scratch to be simple, scalable, and performant. With 200 validator nodes, the network can process about 75,000 transactions per second, making Starlight the highest-throughput network in existence.

This project is the reference implementation of the Starlight protocol, written in Rust.
