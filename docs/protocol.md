# Protocol

The state of the Starlight network is defined by the set of transactions on its blockchain. Instead of requiring mining or staking to extend the chain, Starlight adopts a slot-based mechanism. Time is divided into slots of a certain length (currently 500ms). For each slot, a validator is randomly selected, based on their weight, to be the leader for that slot, the unique account that is allowed to produce a block to extend the chain. Validators forward received transactions directly to the leader, who bundles them into a block, which is broken into shreds that are broadcast through the network.

Some blockchains, such as Bitcoin, rely on probabilistic finality: a transaction is never truly "irreversible", only more and more likely to be so as more and more blocks are built on top of it. Starlight, in contrast, provides deterministic finality. Every Starlight account selects a representative, a validator that they believe to be trustworthy. The sum of the balances of all the accounts who choose a certain validator as their representative make up that validatorâ€™s weight, their voting power in the Starlight consensus protocol. Validators vote for blocks using a slight variant of the Casper-FFG protocol, which provides a mathematical guarantee that so long as 66% of the network voting weight remains non-malicious, any block that is considered finalized will be forever accepted by all nodes. Starlight transactions typically achieve finality within 1 to 2 seconds.
